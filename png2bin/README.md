# png2bin

For more information, please look at [**the project page**](https://github.com/lovasoa/bin2png#bin2png).

## Usage

You first need to encode a file with [bin2png](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bin2png).
Then, you can inline it as a [base64 data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs),
and inline it in an HTML file like this:

```html
<img id="myfile"
    decoding="async" loading="eager"
    style="display:none"
    src="data:image/png;base64,..." />
```

In your code, you can then decode the image and get back the original file data:

```js
var img = document.getElementById("myfile");
var mydata = await png2bin(img);
// mydata is an Uint8Array with the contents of the original file
```
